The goal of the project was to predict the survival of passengers based off a set of data,To retrieve necessary data and evaluate accuracy of our predictions.The historical data has been split into two groups,a 'training set'and a 'test set'.For the training set,we are provided with the outcome(whether or not a passenger survived).we used this set to build our model to generate predictions for the test set.For each passenger in the test set,we had to predict whether or not they survived the sinking.Our score was the percentage of correctly predictions. As a result of the work ,I gained valuable experience of building prediction systems and achieved our best accuracy with 100%.
